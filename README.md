# cs370_proj2
CS370 project 2

NOTES:
---------------
all files are provided in the folder

  -images and the encrypted equivalents

  -p3_2.py is part 3.2
  
  -p3_3w.py is for 3.3 weak collision resistance
  (near the end of the program it may seem like weak collision is frozen but it just takes a few seconds to finish up)
  
  -p3_3s.py is for 3.3 strong collision resistance
  
  
  I included the .bak files just in case to test the reverse if you want.
  My observations are located in the pdf within the folder provided.

INSTRUCTIONS to compile & run
---------------
1. make sure the "words.txt" file is in the same directory as the "p3_2.py" program to correctly test for part 3.2 in the project assigment.

2. To compile. "python2 p3_2.py"
               "python2 p3_3w.py"
               "python2 p3_3s.py"
